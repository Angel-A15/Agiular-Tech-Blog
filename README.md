# Agiular-Tech-Blog

## Project
As a developr, I want a CMS-style blog site so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions.

The construction and functionality of my application should include:
  * The homepage is displayed when I visit the site for the first time, but will redirect me to log-in or sign-up if I want to access other features
  * The ability to add, edit, delete posts
  * Idleing for a duration of time will log me out
  * Feature to log-in/log-out
  * Fucntionality of posts occur only when signed in
  
## Description
For my application to work properly I implamented:
  * Api routes for GET, DELETE, POST, PUT for commets/posts, cookies, and log-in/log-out
  * Handlebars, authentication addition to api routes, and partials to display features only when signed in
